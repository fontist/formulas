      description: 'Cambria has been designed for on-screen reading and to look good
        when printed at small sizes. It has very even spacing and proportions. Diagonal
        and vertical hairlines and serifs are relatively strong, while horizontal
        serifs are small and intend to emphasize stroke endings rather than stand
        out themselves. This principle is most noticeable in the italics where the
        lowercase characters are subdued in style to be at their best as elements
        of word-images. When Cambria is used for captions at sizes over 20 point,
        the  inter-character spacing should be slightly reduced for best results.
        The design isn''t just intended for business documents: The regular weight
        has been extended with a large set of math and science symbols. The Greek
        and Cyrillic has been designed under close supervision of an international
        team of experts, who aimed to set a historical new standard in multi-script
        type design.'

    description: This remarkable typeface first appeared in 1932 in The Times of London
      newspaper, for which it was designed.  It has subsequently become one of the
      worlds most successful type creations.  The original drawings were made under
      Stanley Morison's direction by Victor Lardent at The Times.  It then went through
      an extensive iterative process involving further work in Monotype's Type Drawing
      Office.  Based on experiments Morison had conducted using Perpetua and Plantin,
      it has many old style characteristics but was adapted to give excellent legibility
      coupled with good economy.  Widely used in books and magazines, for reports,
      office documents and also for display and advertising.

    It is a fact that Linux lacks good high quality fonts for general use. In
    the other hand, Microsoft invests time and money to provide a nice and
    clean look and feel with high quality fonts like Verdana and Tahoma. The
    result of this work is found in their typography
    (http://microsoft.com/typography) web site. This is an attempt to give
    Linux end users a very easy way to use them, trough an RPM package.

    These fonts are free only for who have a Microsoft Windows license.

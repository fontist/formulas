      description: 'Cambria has been designed for on-screen reading and to look good
        when printed at small sizes. It has very even spacing and proportions. Diagonal
        and vertical hairlines and serifs are relatively strong, while horizontal
        serifs are small and intend to emphasize stroke endings rather than stand
        out themselves. This principle is most noticeable in the italics where the
        lowercase characters are subdued in style to be at their best as elements
        of word-images. When Cambria is used for captions at sizes over 20 point,
        the  inter-character spacing should be slightly reduced for best results.
        The design isn''t just intended for business documents: The regular weight
        has been extended with a large set of math and science symbols. The Greek
        and Cyrillic has been designed under close supervision of an international
        team of experts, who aimed to set a historical new standard in multi-script
        type design.'

    description: Monotype Drawing Office 1982. A contemporary sans serif design, Arial
      contains more humanist characteristics than many of its predecessors and as
      such is more in tune with the mood of the last decades of the twentieth century.
      The overall treatment of curves is softer and fuller than in most industrial-style
      sans serif faces. Terminal strokes are cut on the diagonal which helps to give
      the face a less mechanical appearance. Arial is an extremely versatile family
      of typefaces which can be used with equal success for text setting in reports,
      presentations, magazines etc, and for display use in newspapers, advertising
      and promotions.

    description: The origins of Bookman Old Style lie in the typeface called Oldstyle
      Antique, designed by A C Phemister circa 1858 for the Miller and Richard foundry
      in Edinburgh, Scotland. Many American foundries made versions of this type which
      eventually became known as Bookman. Monotype Bookman Old Style roman is based
      on earlier Lanston Monotype and ATF models. The italic has been re drawn following
      the style of the Oldstyle Antique italics of Miller and Richard. Although called
      'Old Style', the near vertical stress of the face puts it into the transitional
      category. A legible and robust text face.

    description: 'Cambria has been designed for on-screen reading and to look good
      when printed at small sizes. It has very even spacing and proportions. Diagonal
      and vertical hairlines and serifs are relatively strong, while horizontal serifs
      are small and intend to emphasize stroke endings rather than stand out themselves.
      This principle is most noticeable in the italics where the lowercase characters
      are subdued in style to be at their best as elements of word-images. When Cambria
      is used for captions at sizes over 20 point, the  inter-character spacing should
      be slightly reduced for best results. The design isn''t just intended for business
      documents: The regular weight has been extended with a large set of math and
      science symbols. The Greek and Cyrillic has been designed under close supervision
      of an international team of experts, who aimed to set a historical new standard
      in multi-script type design.'

    description: Another member of the Century family which was based on Century Expanded.
      Designed to fulfill the need for a solid, legible face for printing schoolbooks.
      It is wider and heavier than Century Expanded, there is also less contrast between
      thick and thin strokes. First cut by Monotype in 1934 and based on versions
      from ATF and Lanston Monotype. The sturdy nature of this typeface, coupled with
      its inherent legibility, has made it a popular choice for setting books, newspapers
      and magazines.

      old typewriters, making it a good choice for personal and business correspondance.
      The improved Windows font display allowed a design with proportions closer to
      normal text than traditional monospaced fonts like Courier. This allows for
      more comfortably reading of extended text on screen. OpenType features include
      hanging or lining numerals; slashed, dotted and normal zeros; and alternative
      shapes for a number of lowercase letters. The look of text can be tuned to personal
      taste by varying the number of bars and waves.

      or intermediate weights were ever developed. In 1979, under license from ATF,
      ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy.
      Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics,
      but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also
      features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned
      the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed
      versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness
      of the design.'

      on those used by Aldus Manutius in 1495 and cut by Francesco Griffo. The italic
      is based on types cut in France circa 1557 by Robert Granjon. Garamond is a

      of applications. It works particularly well in books and lengthy text settings.

      very bold alphabet of all capitals – schmalfette means "bold condensed" in German,
      and grotesk indicates it is without serifs.

      for on-screen reading. The letterforms are generously open and well-proportioned;
      legible and clear at smaller sizes, and dynamic at larger display sizes. The
      beauty of this face is that it sets text lines in Japanese with Roman seamlessly
      and harmoniously. The balanced inter-letter spacing enhances horizontal alignment,
      facilitating smooth reading flow. Meiryo has a very large character set with
      Japanese and Roman combined, fully scalable outline technology, making it extremely
      functional for all aspects of communication and publishing. It is a robust legible
      typeface yet compact enough to enable tight inter-line spacing which is good
      for space economy.

      designed primarily for use as initial letters. Corsiva can be used for short
      text passages in advertising but is best used to add sparkle to invitations,
      greeting cards and menus, and to give a sense of occasion to certificates and
      awards.

      Palatino, which since its design in 1950 has become one of the world's most
      widely used typefaces. For this new digital version, Professor Zapf has drawn
      numerous additional characters to include an extensive range of ligatures, numerals,
      fractions and support for Cyrillic and both monotonic and polytonic Greek. Special
      care has been taken to enhance the quality of the letterforms when displayed
      on the computer screen, ensuring that Palatino Linotype is highly legible whether
      displayed on the screen or in print. This typeface is ideal for use in extended
      text settings such as books, periodicals and catalogs.

    description: A sensitive adaptation of a style of letter that had been popularized
      for monumental work in stone by Eric Gill. Large scale drawings by Gill were
      given to Charles Malin, a Parisian punch-cutter, and his hand cut punches were
      the basis for the font issued by Monotype. The incised quality of Perpetua will
      lend distinction to any work compatible with its serenity. First used in a private
      translation called 'The Passion of Perpetua and Felicity'; the italic was originally
      called Felicity. Widely used as a text face in quality books, Perpetua is also
      very popular in advertising and display work.

      blobs. Consider this Stencil face a decorative font for limited use; a little

    description: Trebuchet, designed by Vincent Connare in 1996, is a humanist sans

      from the sans serifs of the 1930s which had large x heights and round features
      intended to promote readability on signs. The typeface name is credited to a
      puzzle heard at Microsoft, where the question was asked, "could you build a
      Trebuchet (a form of medieval catapult) to launch a person from the main campus
      to the consumer campus, and how?" The Trebuchet fonts are intended to be the
      vehicle that fires your messages across the Internet. "Launch your message with
      a Trebuchet page".

    description: 20th Century was designed and drawn by Sol Hess in the Lanston Monotype
      drawing office between 1936 and 1947. The first weights were added to the Monotype
      typeface library in 1959. This is a face based on geometric shapes which originated
      in Germany in the early 1920's and became an integral part of the Bauhaus movement
      of that time. Form and function became the key words, unnecessary decoration
      was scorned. This clean cut, sans serif with geometric shapes was most appropriate.
      The lighter weights can be used for text setting, the bold and condensed fonts
      are suitable for display in headlines and advertising.

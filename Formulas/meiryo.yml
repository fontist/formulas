      description: Meiryo is a very versatile modern sans serif type designed to give
        an exceptionally clean appearance on screen, as well as in print. It is optimized
        for on-screen reading. The letterforms are generously open and well-proportioned;
        legible and clear at smaller sizes, and dynamic at larger display sizes. The
        beauty of this face is that it sets text lines in Japanese with Roman seamlessly
        and harmoniously. The balanced inter-letter spacing enhances horizontal alignment,
        facilitating smooth reading flow. Meiryo has a very large character set with
        Japanese and Roman combined, fully scalable outline technology, making it
        extremely functional for all aspects of communication and publishing. It is
        a robust legible typeface yet compact enough to enable tight inter-line spacing
        which is good for space economy.

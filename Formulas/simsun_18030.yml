  for MICROSOFT WINDOWS Operating Systems


  PLEASE READ THIS SUPPLEMENTAL END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("SUPPLEMENTAL EULA") CAREFULLY.  BY INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.


  1.	General

    The accompanying Microsoft software includes computer software and may include associated media, printed materials, and online or electronic documentation (collectively, the "Components").  The Components are provided to supplement existing functionality of Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 operating systems (the "Software").  Your use of the Components is subject to the terms and conditions of this Supplemental EULA and, as set forth below, the end user license agreement (either from Microsoft or some other entity) under which you have previously licensed the Software (the "Software EULA").

  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A VALIDLY LICENSED COPY OF THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO INSTALL, COPY OR OTHERWISE USE THE COMPONENTS AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS UNDER THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA.

  2.	General Terms and Conditions of Your Use of the Components

  2.1	Microsoft grants you a license to the Components equivalent to, and subject to the same conditions, limitations and restrictions as, the license that the Software EULA grants you with respect to the Software, except as set forth below.

  2.2	You may reproduce, install and use one copy of the Components per validly licensed copy of the Software to update each such copy.

  2.3	The Components are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties.  Microsoft Corporation or its suppliers own the title, copyright, and other intellectual property rights in the Components.  All rights not expressly granted to you in this Supplemental EULA are reserved.  The Components are licensed, not sold.

  2.4	Capitalized terms used in this Supplemental EULA and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Software EULA.

  3.	Additional Rights and Limitations

  If the Software was licensed to you by Microsoft or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries, the limited warranty (if any) included in the Software EULA applies to the Components provided that the Components have been licensed to you within the term of that limited warranty.  However, this Supplemental EULA does not extend the time period for which that limited warranty is provided.

  If the Software was licensed to you by an entity other than Microsoft or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries, then (a) "Manufacturer" under the Software EULA is not a party to this Supplemental EULA and has no obligation under this Supplemental EULA to provide support for the Components, (b) the Components constitute "Supplemental Components" within the meaning of the Software EULA, and (c) this Supplemental EULA in no way amends or alters the Software EULA.  IF THE SOFTWARE WAS LICENSED TO YOU BY AN ENTITY OTHER THAN MICROSOFT OR ANY OF ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, THEN THE FOLLOWING THREE PARAGRAPHS ALSO APPLY:

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Microsoft and its suppliers provide TO YOU the Components and support services (if any) AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS; and Microsoft and its suppliers hereby disclaim all OTHER warranties and conditions, whether express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, any (if any) IMPLIED warranties, DUTIES or conditions of MERCHANTABILITY, OF fitness for a particular purpose, OF RELIABILITY OR AVAILABILITY, OF ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF RESPONSES, OF RESULTS, OF WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, OF LACK OF VIRUSES, AND OF LACK OF NEGLIGENCE, ALL WITH REGARD TO THE COMPONENTS, AND THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT OR OTHER SERVICES, INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, AND RELATED CONTENT THROUGH THE COMPONENTS OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE COMPONENTS.  also, there is no warranty or condition of title, quiet enjoyment, quiet possession, correspondence to description or non-infringement with regard to the Components.

  EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Microsoft or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, PUNITIVE, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits OR confidential or other information, FOR business interruption, FOR personal injury, FOR loss of privacy, FOR failure to meet any duty including of good faith or of reasonable care, negligence, and any other pecuniary or other loss whatsoever) arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Components, THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT OR OTHER SERVICES, INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, AND RELATED CONTENT THROUGH THE COMPONENTS OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE COMPONENTS, OR OTHERWISE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF THE FAULT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), MISREPRESENTATION, STRICT OR PRODUCT LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR BREACH OF WARRANTY OF MICROSOFT OR ANY SUPPLIER, AND EVEN IF MICROSOFT OR ANY SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES.  Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, all damages referenced above and all direct or general damages IN CONTRACT OR ANYTHING ELSE), the entire liability of Microsoft and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Supplemental EULA and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the greater of the ACTUAL DAMAGES YOU INCUR IN REASONABLE RELIANCE ON THE components UP TO THE AMOUNT actually paid by you for the Components or U.S.$5.00.  The foregoing limitations, exclusions and disclaimers shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, even if any remedy fails its essential purpose.

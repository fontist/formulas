    description: Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed
      by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family
      by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini.
      It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining numerals,
      standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as
      well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces
      than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.

  PREAMBLE
  The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
  development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
  efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
  open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
  with others.

  The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
  redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
  fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
  redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
  names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
  however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
  requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
  to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

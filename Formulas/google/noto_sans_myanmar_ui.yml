  -----------------------------------------------------------
  SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
  -----------------------------------------------------------

  PREAMBLE
  The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
  development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
  efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
  open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
  with others.

  The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
  redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
  fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
  redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
  names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
  however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
  requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
  to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

  DEFINITIONS
  "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
  Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
  include source files, build scripts and documentation.

  "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
  copyright statement(s).

  "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
  distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

  "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
  or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
  Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
  new environment.

  "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
  writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

  PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
  a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
  redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
  Software, subject to the following conditions:

  1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
  in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

  2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
  redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
  contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
  included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
  in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
  binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

  3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
  Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
  Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
  presented to the users.

  4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
  Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
  Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
  Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
  permission.

  5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
  must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
  distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
  remain under this license does not apply to any document created
  using the Font Software.

  TERMINATION
  This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
  not met.

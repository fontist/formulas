    description: Contemporary sans serif design, Arial contains more humanist characteristics
      than many of its predecessors and as such is more in tune with the mood of the
      last decades of the twentieth century.  The overall treatment of curves is softer
      and fuller than in most industrial style sans serif faces.  Terminal strokes
      are cut on the diagonal which helps to give the face a less mechanical appearance.  Arial
      is an extremely versatile family of typefaces which can be used with equal success
      for text setting in reports, presentations, magazines etc, and for display use
      in newspapers, advertising and promotions.

    description: This remarkable typeface first appeared in 1932 in The Times of London
      newspaper, for which it was designed.  It has subsequently become one of the
      worlds most successful type creations.  The original drawings were made under
      Stanley Morison's direction by Victor Lardent at The Times.  It then went through
      an extensive iterative process involving further work in Monotype's Type Drawing
      Office.  Based on experiments Morison had conducted using Perpetua and Plantin,
      it has many old style characteristics but was adapted to give excellent legibility
      coupled with good economy.  Widely used in books and magazines, for reports,
      office documents and also for display and advertising.

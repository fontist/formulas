    description: Malgun Gothic is a Korean font developed by taking advantage of ClearType
      technology, and it provides excellent reading experience particularly onscreen.
      Its elements are created based on the typeface of Hunminjeongeum, and streamlined
      with modern form of characters as well as upright and well-regulated strokes.
      The font is very legible at small sizes with its moderate open counters, and
      its even inter-character spacing and visual center line maximize the readability.
